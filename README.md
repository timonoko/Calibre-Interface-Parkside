This is otherwise the same as https://github.com/Matthias-Wandel/caliper-interface

But Lidl Parkside Caliper has 3V battery and thus the signal level is 2V, so
level adjustement not needed.

But protocol is little bit different.

You can connect ESP8266 directly, you dont need even battery, because 3V battery.  

Negative numbers not done, but they are probably the about same as with herr Wandel. (Last 5 bits
are not zero?)
